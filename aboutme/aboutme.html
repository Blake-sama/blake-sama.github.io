    <p class="center">
      Ever since I turned 14, and fell in love the Japanese-style of cartoons . . . "Anime", I have dreamt of a place where I could share my love for this media on my own platform, my own way.
      <br><br>
      The reason I wanted to develop my own website, instead of building a brand on several other platforms, is partially for the sake of creative freedom. The other portion? Well I have many types of content I want to create, and I believe a shared center to access all that is "Blake-sama" is ideal.
